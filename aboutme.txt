About Me

Originating from the south, moved to Chicago about 9 years ago for a job as a market executive for a real estate company in downtown Chicago. Ended up migrating to production design and IT within that company. Working here I learned how to deal with clients, create and manage time sensitive products, and critical problem solving skills. This is where I got my first taste of design. After the 2008 crash, the real estate industry took a huge hit, so using my new found skills I decided to go back to school for Web design and development. I've been developing for over 7 years now and it never gets old. What I love about web developing is bringing the client's idea into existence. Breathing life into pure thought and molding it into a piece of digital art.
